# Project FLOSSWAY

## Introduction

### What is the goal of this project?

This project is going to answer the question of how to run an open-source community.

* How to build and maintain developer relationships?
* How to work in both community and company?
* How to measure an open-source community?

### What does FLOSSWAY stand for?

FLOSSWAY is almost the way to building a "Free/Libre and Open Source Software". Read the article [FLOSS and FOSS](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.html).

FLOSS is possibly also "flowers" + "blossom" in pronunciation.
