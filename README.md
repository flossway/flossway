# FLOSSWAY

## Introduction

### What is the goal of this project?

This project is going to answer the question of how to build an open-source community.

### What does FLOSSWAY stand for?

FLOSSWAY is almost the way to building a "Free/Libre and Open Source Software". Read the article [FLOSS and FOSS](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.html).

FLOSS is possibly also "flowers" + "blossom" in pronunciation.
